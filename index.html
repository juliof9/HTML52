            Summer is after so often a time of <br>
            accidental vegetarianism. It's when even <br>
            carnivorous folk(myself among them) are <br>
            seduce by fields and farms stands, lured in by lettuce and tempted by tomatoes. We <br>
            don't necessatily set out go meatless. But a couple of fruit smoothies and several <br>
            bowls of baby greens later in the lazy heat of a stove avoiding afternoon, that's just <br>
            what happens. And so, to help you make the most of summer's bounty, here are 10 <br>
            cookbooks that take their inspiration from that most peaceful of kingdoms-the <br>
            plant kingdom.
